##Exercise 33 : ng-repeat and $index, $event, $log

##Summary
You are provided with FIFA's ranking view but the positions are not displayed. Complete the template to display the position correctly. 
Fix the button so it would display the position of Poland in the ranking and display what the event is called on the button.   

##Goals
Display all country positions in the `ranking` table 
You would like to know **Where is Poland?** and what is a type of event when you press the button. 
As you are very inquisitive man - get all information about MouseEvent without 'console.log'.Display the event type in `<code></code>` tag
